# 0x14.C - Bit Manipulation

## Definition
Bit manipulation is a technique in programming where you manipulate individual bits of a binary representation of data. This is often done using bitwise operators. A bit is the smallest unit (to store data) in computer memeory. It is one-eighth of a byte. A byte is 8 bits. The following is the list of most commonly used bitwise operators in C:

## Bitwise Operators:
+ `&`	-	AND
+ `|`	-	OR
+ `^` 	-	Bitwise XoR
+ `~` 	-	Bitwise Not
+ `<<`	-	Left shift
+ `>>`	-	Right shift

## Tasks:
0. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to
   get from one number to another.
